## Interactive Sound System Implementation 

Build a real-time sound propagation system focused on accurate ray-based acoustics:

1. **Ray-Based Sound Propagation**
   - Emit 128-1024 rays in spherical distribution from each sound source
   - Track per-ray properties:
     - Energy level
     - 5-band frequency spectrum (low/low-mid/mid/upper-mid/high)
     - Direction vector
     - Total travel time
   - Perform continuous ray tracing each frame to handle dynamic environments

2. **Material Properties** 
   - Define acoustic properties per surface:
     ```rust
     struct Material {
         absorption: [f32; 5],    // Per-band absorption [0-1]
         reflectivity: f32,       // Overall reflection coefficient [0-1]
         diffusion: f32,          // Scattering factor [0-1] 
         transmission: f32        // Energy loss through material [0-1]
     }
     ```

3. **Sound Processing Pipeline**
   - Use 

[AudioBandProcessor](../src/filter.rs)

 for 5-band frequency filtering
   - Apply per-material acoustic effects:
     - Frequency-dependent absorption
     - Specular/diffuse reflection
     - Transmission loss
     - Distance attenuation (1/rÂ²)

4. **Audio Management**
   ```rust
   struct SoundSystem {
       active_sounds: Vec<Sound>,
       listener: Listener,
       environment: Environment
   }
   
   impl SoundSystem {
       fn update(&mut self) {
           // Update ray paths for all active sounds
           // Process audio based on new ray data
           // Output spatialized audio via HRTF
       }
   }
   ```

The system continuously traces rays and updates audio processing in real-time to maintain accurate acoustic simulation as the scene changes.
