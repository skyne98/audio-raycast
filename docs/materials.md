- **Absorption:** Per-band absorption coefficients for five frequency bands (Low, Low-Mid, Mid, Upper-Mid, High). Values range from 0 (no absorption) to 1 (complete absorption).
- **Reflectivity:** Overall reflection coefficient (0 to 1).
- **Diffusion:** Scattering factor indicating the proportion of diffuse reflection (0 to 1).
- **Transmission:** Energy loss through the material (0 to 1).

### **Material Descriptions and Acoustic Characteristics**

1. **Concrete**
   - **Absorption:** Low absorption across all bands, slightly increasing with frequency.
   - **Reflectivity:** High, making it a strong reflector.
   - **Diffusion:** Minimal diffusion, leading to mostly specular reflections.
   - **Transmission:** Low transmission; concrete is largely opaque to sound.

2. **Wood Panel**
   - **Absorption:** Moderate absorption, increasing with frequency.
   - **Reflectivity:** Relatively high reflectivity.
   - **Diffusion:** Moderate diffusion, providing a balance between specular and diffuse reflections.
   - **Transmission:** Low transmission; wood panels are generally sound barriers.

3. **Glass**
   - **Absorption:** Very low absorption, especially in lower frequencies.
   - **Reflectivity:** Very high reflectivity.
   - **Diffusion:** Minimal diffusion, leading to clear reflections.
   - **Transmission:** High transmission, allowing significant sound to pass through.

4. **Carpet**
   - **Absorption:** High absorption across all frequency bands.
   - **Reflectivity:** Low reflectivity, absorbing most sound energy.
   - **Diffusion:** High diffusion, scattering sound in multiple directions.

5. **Metal**
   - **Absorption:** Extremely low absorption, almost all sound is reflected.
   - **Reflectivity:** Very high reflectivity.
   - **Diffusion:** Minimal diffusion.
   - **Transmission:** No transmission; metal surfaces are impervious to sound.

   - **Absorption:** Moderate absorption, slightly increasing with frequency.
   - **Reflectivity:** High reflectivity.
   - **Diffusion:** Moderate diffusion.
   - **Transmission:** Low transmission; bricks are effective sound barriers.

7. **Fabric Curtain**

9. **Plywood**
   - **Absorption:** Moderate absorption, increasing with frequency.
   - **Reflectivity:** Moderate to high reflectivity.
   - **Diffusion:** Moderate diffusion.
   - **Transmission:** Low transmission.

10. **Cork**
    - **Absorption:** Very high absorption, effective across all frequencies.
    - **Reflectivity:** Low to moderate reflectivity.
    - **Diffusion:** High diffusion.
    - **Transmission:** Low transmission.

### **Notes on Usage**

- **Frequency Bands:** The absorption values are tailored to five distinct frequency bands. Depending on your implementation, you might need to adjust these bands to match specific ranges (e.g., 100-250 Hz for Low, 250-500 Hz for Low-Mid, etc.).
- **Balancing Properties:** When selecting or designing materials for your sound system, consider how their properties interact. For example, materials with high absorption and diffusion like carpets can create a more acoustically "dead" environment, reducing echoes and reverberation.
- **Customization:** Feel free to tweak these values based on empirical testing or specific acoustic requirements of your game environment to achieve the desired sound realism and performance.

### **Implementation Example in Rust**

Here's how you might define some of these materials in Rust using your `Material` struct:

```rust
struct Material {
    absorption: [f32; 5],    // Per-band absorption [0-1]
    reflectivity: f32,       // Overall reflection coefficient [0-1]
    diffusion: f32,          // Scattering factor [0-1]
    transmission: f32        // Energy loss through material [0-1]
}

const CONCRETE: Material = Material {
    absorption: [0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.12, 0.15],
    reflectivity: 0.80,
    diffusion: 0.10,
    transmission: 0.05,
};

const WOOD_PANEL: Material = Material {
    absorption: [0.10, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, 0.20],
    reflectivity: 0.70,
    diffusion: 0.20,
    transmission: 0.05,
};

// Define other materials similarly...
```
